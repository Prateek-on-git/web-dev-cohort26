## 1. What a browser actually is (beyond “it opens websites”)

A browser is a **client application** that:

* Talks to servers over the internet (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Downloads resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, video…)
* Interprets those resources according to web standards
* Builds an internal model of the page
* Turns that model into pixels on your screen
* Handles user input (clicks, typing, scrolling)

In short:
**Browser = network client + code interpreter + graphics engine + UI app**

---

## 2. Main parts of a browser (high-level)

At a very high level, most modern browsers have these pieces:

1. **User Interface (UI)**
2. **Browser Engine**
3. **Rendering Engine**
4. **Networking**
5. **JavaScript Engine**
6. **Data Storage** (cache, cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB)

---

## 3. User Interface (UI)

This is the part *you* see and interact with:

* Address bar (URL bar)
* Tabs
* Back / forward / refresh buttons
* Bookmarks
* DevTools

Important point:
👉 **The UI is NOT the web page**
The page lives *inside* the browser UI.

---

## 4. Browser Engine vs Rendering Engine (simple distinction)

This is a super common confusion, so here’s the clean mental model:

### Browser Engine

* Acts as the **boss / coordinator**
* Connects UI actions to the rendering engine
* Example: “User typed a URL → go fetch → render it”

### Rendering Engine

* Does the **actual work of displaying web content**
* Parses HTML & CSS
* Builds layout
* Paints pixels

Examples:

* **Blink** (Chrome, Edge)
* **WebKit** (Safari)
* **Gecko** (Firefox)

📌 Think of it like this:

* Browser Engine = project manager
* Rendering Engine = construction crew

## 5. Networking: how a browser fetches HTML, CSS, JS

When you enter a URL:

1. Browser checks cache (already have it?)
2. If not, it makes an **HTTP request**
3. Server responds with:

   * HTML file
   * Headers (content type, caching rules, etc.)
4. Browser then discovers **more files to fetch**:

   * CSS (`<link>`)
   * JavaScript (`<script>`)
   * Images, fonts, etc.

Key idea:
👉 **HTML is just the starting point**
The browser keeps downloading resources as it parses.

---

## 6. HTML parsing and DOM creation

HTML is **not displayed directly**.

The browser:

1. Reads HTML **token by token**
2. Understands tags (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`)
3. Builds a tree structure called the **DOM (Document Object Model)**

Example:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</body>
```

Becomes a tree:

```
Document
 └─ body
    ├─ h1 → "Hello"
    └─ p  → "World"
```

📌 DOM = **structured representation of the HTML**

JavaScript interacts with *this*, not raw HTML text.

---

## 7. CSS parsing and CSSOM creation

CSS also gets parsed—but separately.

The browser:

1. Downloads CSS files
2. Parses rules
3. Builds the **CSSOM (CSS Object Model)**

Example:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Becomes a structure like:

* Selector: `p`
* Rules: `color = red`

📌 CSSOM = **all styling rules, structured and ready to apply**

---

## 8. How DOM and CSSOM come together

The browser combines:

* **DOM** (what elements exist)
* **CSSOM** (how they should look)

This creates the **Render Tree**:

* Only visible elements
* Each node knows:

  * Its content
  * Its styles

Hidden elements (`display: none`) don’t make it in.

---

## 9. Layout (reflow), painting, and display

Once the render tree exists:

### 1. Layout (Reflow)

* Calculate:

  * Widths
  * Heights
  * Positions
* Depends on:

  * Screen size
  * Fonts
  * Box model

### 2. Paint

* Convert each box into:

  * Colors
  * Text
  * Borders
  * Shadows

### 3. Display (Compositing)

* Layers combined
* Pixels pushed to the screen

---

## 10. Very basic idea of parsing (simple math example)

Parsing = **turning raw text into structured meaning**

Example string:

```
"2 + 3 * 4"
```

Steps:

1. Break into tokens:
   `2`, `+`, `3`, `*`, `4`
2. Apply rules (order of operations)
3. Build a structure:

   ```
       +
      / \
     2   *
        / \
       3   4
   ```
4. Evaluate → `14`

Browsers do the same thing:

* HTML → DOM tree
* CSS → CSSOM tree
* JS → Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

---

## Big picture mental model (one sentence)

**A browser downloads text, parses it into trees, combines those trees into a visual model,
and continuously updates pixels as you interact with the page.**
