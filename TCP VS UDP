## What are TCP and UDP?

**TCP** and **UDP** are both **transport-layer protocols**.
They sit between applications (like web browsers, games, video calls) and the network (IP).

Their job: **move data from one computer to another**.

---

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Think of TCP like **sending a registered package** 📦

* Makes sure data arrives
* Sends data **in order**
* Resends missing pieces
* Slower, but very reliable

TCP **cares about correctness** more than speed.

---

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Think of UDP like **shouting messages across a room** 📢

* Sends data fast
* No guarantee it arrives
* No ordering
* No retries

UDP **cares about speed** more than reliability.

## Key Differences Between TCP and UDP

| Feature        | TCP                 | UDP            |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Connection     | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability    | Guaranteed delivery | Best effort    |
| Order          | Preserves order     | No ordering    |
| Error handling | Yes (retries)       | No             |
| Speed          | Slower              | Faster         |
| Overhead       | Higher              | Lower          |

## When to Use TCP

Use TCP when **data must be correct and complete**.

Examples:

* Web pages
* Emails
* File downloads
* APIs
* Databases

If even **one missing byte matters**, TCP is the move.

---

## When to Use UDP

Use UDP when **speed matters more than perfection**.

Examples:

* Live video/audio
* Online gaming
* Voice calls
* DNS lookups

If a little data loss is okay but **latency is not**, UDP wins.

## Common Real-World Examples

### TCP in the real world

* Loading a website
* Sending an email
* Downloading a PDF
* HTTPS traffic

### UDP in the real world

* Zoom / Discord calls
* Live streaming
* Multiplayer games

## What is HTTP and Where It Fits

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is an **application-layer protocol**.

It defines:

* How browsers request data
* How servers respond
* Status codes (200, 404, etc.)
* Headers, methods (GET, POST…)

HTTP does **not** move data itself.
It **relies on transport protocols** underneath.

---

## Relationship Between TCP and HTTP

* **HTTP usually runs on TCP**
* TCP handles **delivery**
* HTTP handles **meaning**

Think of it like this:

* **TCP** = the delivery truck 🚚
* **HTTP** = the rules for what’s inside the package 📄

So when you open a website:

1. Browser uses **HTTP** to request a page
2. HTTP data is sent using **TCP**
3. TCP ensures everything arrives correctly
4. Browser renders the page

## One-Sentence Summary

* **TCP = reliable but slower**
* **UDP = fast but unreliable**
* **HTTP = web rules that usually run on TCP**
