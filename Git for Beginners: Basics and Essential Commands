Git for Beginners: Basics and Essential Commands

What is Git - Git is a Version Control System. It is used to manage versions of code across the developers working on it.

Why Git is Used - To avoid code conflicts. If it is not used, code will not remain sane. For example, one developer changes or edit won't be available 
to others to work upon in real time. The state of the program can be managed easily and if there is any issue in the code, then the previous versions 
can be tracked and deployed if required. It also helps in keeping a record of who worked on it and when was it pushed, with what changes. This makes it 
easier for the developers to work on it.

Git Basics and Core Terminologies
Repository - A folder for your code, config files for git to keep a record of changes.
Add - Moves codes into staging area; Staging area is a sort of cache for git.
Commit - Moves code from staging area to the git records
Branch - A copy of the main code, from where one can edit/modify the code and later commit it back to the main repo

Common Git Commands

git init - Create a new repo
git add <file>   - stage a file
git add . - Stage all changes
git commit -m "msg" - commit staged changes with a msg
git commit -am "msg" - stage track files + commit //works only for tracked files.
git diff            -shows the changes you have made but not staged yet
git reset --soft    - moves head back but keeps all changes staged
git reset --hard    -  moves head back and delete all changes
git revert <commited hash> - creates a new commit that undoes the specified commit hash

Git working -
Think of Git like ordering food 
Kitchen = Working directory
Plate = Staging area
Serving table = Commit

You don’t serve everything cooking, you plate only what’s ready.
