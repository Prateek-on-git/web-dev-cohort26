🙏What DNS is (explained in very simple terms)
        DNS is what turns a website name humans remember
        👉 example.com
        into a number computers understand
        👉 93.184.216.34
        
        💡 Without DNS, you’d have to type numbers instead of website names every time.
        
        Analogy:
        DNS is like your phone’s contacts:
        
        You tap “Mom”
        
        Phone actually dials +91-9XXXXXXXXX

🙏Why DNS records are needed
        A domain can do many things, not just show a website:

        1.Load a website

        2.Send/receive emails

        3.Verify ownership (Google, Facebook, SSL, etc.)

        4.Redirect traffic

         Each of these needs instructions.
        📌 Those instructions are called DNS records.

🙏What an NS Record is (who is responsible for a domain)        
        NS = Name Server
        NS records answer the question:
        👉 “Who manages the DNS for this domain?”
        Example:

        example.com → ns1.cloudflare.com
        example.com → ns2.cloudflare.com

        Meaning:
        “Cloudflare is responsible for answering all DNS questions for this domain.”

        🧠 Think of NS like:
        “Who holds the master file for this domain?”
⚠️ If NS records are wrong → nothing works (site, email, everything).

🙏What an A Record is (domain → IPv4 address)
        A = Address
        It connects a domain name to a server IP address (IPv4).
        Example:
        example.com → 93.184.216.34
        Meaning:
        “When someone opens example.com, send them to this server.”

        🧠 This is the most basic and common DNS record.

🙏What an AAAA Record is (domain → IPv6 address)
        AAAA = IPv6 Address
        Same as A record, but for IPv6 (newer internet addresses).
        Example:
        example.com → 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946
        📌 Many sites have both A and AAAA records.

🙏What a CNAME Record is (one name pointing to another name)
        CNAME = Canonical Name
        It means:
        “This name is just an alias of another name.”
        Example:
        www.example.com → example.com
        Meaning:
        www.example.com does NOT have its own IP
        It simply points to example.com
        Then DNS looks up the A/AAAA record of example.com

What an MX Record is (how emails find your mail server)
