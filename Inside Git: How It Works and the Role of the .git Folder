Inside Git: How It Works and the Role of the .git Folder
Git folder is a local repo, which is created on the use of git init command. This folder keeps a record of main file, changes, branch infos.
Basically the complete history of the code.



How Git Works Internally-
Think of Git like ordering food https://github.com/Prateek-on-git/web-dev-cohort26/tree/main
Kitchen = Working directory
Plate = Staging area
Serving table = Commit
You don’t serve everything cooking, you plate only what’s ready.



Understanding the .git Folder
There two parts. One main project file, on which we are working.
second git folder - Git map, if you delete it, it will remove all history, commits, branches
It contains 
  1. Objects - all file data & history (probably encrypted, so that no one messes directly)
  2. Refs - Branches & tags (to point and locate the files with hash code.
  3. HEAD - where the current work is going on
  4. Index - Staging area 


Git Objects: Blob, Tree, Commit
Blob - File content - Stores raw file data 
Tree - Folder structure - file organiser
Commit - a snapshot of the project at the current. It contains, tree, parent commit, author info, msg and timestamp




How Git Tracks Changes
- It doesn't track changes, it tracks snapshots. When one commit, it stores the entire project state but reuses blobs that didn't change.
Which helps in avoiding storing duplicates.

What Happens during git add and git add file.txt
- Git reads file content, create a blob object, stores in .git/objects, updates the index (staging area) to point to that blob.
- Nothing is commited yet.
- Staging is like selecting blob for the next snapshot

What happens during git commit and git commit -m msg
- Git reads the index, builds a tree from staged blob to the main and point head to this commit. 
- Commit is taking snapshot from the selected blob
- Each blob have a unique hash to point it and find it.
